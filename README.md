App Extensions: a way for you to share your app’s functionality with other apps or the OS itself. One of these types of extensions is a Today Extension, also known as a Widget. These allow you to present information in the Notification Center and Lock Screen, and are a great way to provide immediate and up-to-date information that the user is interested in.
